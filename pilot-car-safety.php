				<h1>Pilot Car Safety</h1>
				<i>June 23, 2009</i>
				<p>A Pilot Car, aka Escort Vehicle, is a car that accompanies an oversize load through a specified area. Every state has a different requirement for pilot cars, such as in California any load that is more than 12 wide, must have 1 pilot car at all times. These pilot cars must have flags, signs, and lights on the car to warn the public that there is an oversized load coming through.</p>
